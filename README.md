# Kth-Largest-number
This project finds the Kth largest number of a data in a text file using several algorithms:

1- Insertion Sort Algorithm ( Sort All)

2- Sort only K-size Algorithm ( Sort K)

3- Sort Heap Algorithm ( Min Heap)

4- Quick Select Algorithm

The test speed performance changes widely between the first and the last algorithm from very slow to very fast. 
To create a test file, all the numbers have to be positive and integer. The first number in the text file will represent the algorithm type (1,2,3, or 4), the second number is the required K number, and the last number is the total number of elements N.
